# 13 Years Remote
## Thriving as a Web Developer Without Burning Out
### Nikola Begedin

Note:

Hey everyone. My name is Nikola and today I'll be talking about how my 13 years of remote work went.

---
# Intro

* I work primarily with Vue and Elixir
* Had two non-remote jobs total
* Partially remote since 2012
* Fully remote since 2013

Note:
A little bit about me.

I primarily work with Vue and Elixir. I had two non-remote jobs in total. I started remote work some time in 2012 and I've beel fully remote since some time in 2013.

This is my 6th talk on Weblice, if I'm counting correctly. I missed one, and I almost missed this one. I originally didn't submit a proposal due to schedule clash, but my schedule cleared up and a slot openned up last week, so here I am.

---
# Goals

* My remote journey
* Lessons learned
* Legal aspect
* Work-life balance (WLB)
* Strategies for growth
* Stories

Note:

My goal today is primarily to share my experience. I'll share some lessons learned and strategies I find to be effective, talk about legal tuff and maybe share a story rot two.

But do keep in mind, my experience is probably different from others who started back then and for sure will be different from anyone starting today

I'm hoping you'll have questions, so I'll also try to leave a bit more room for that at the end. If you end up not having any, we'll have a longer coffee break.

But, I haven't timed any of my rehersals, so we'll see how that actually goes.

# My Remote Journey

* 2012, UpWork (then oDesk), \$5/hour
* Quickly rose to \$11/hour, part-time
* Full-time remote offer shortly after
* Stagnation for 2-3 years
* New gig at €30/hour, became full-time
* Avoided future stagnation

Note:

My first job out of college was actually in Čakovec, a .NET position. It very soon became .NET web development, which is what I actually wanted to go with a the time.

About a year after starting,  got the junior itch to loo for something else, and I did, in Varaždin, with pretty much the exact same tech stack.

Another year later, after living for two years in Varaždin. I didn't know anyone and I didn't really have a reason to meet anyone, so I was bored. 

I learned about the possibility of freelancing and got curious.

Very soon, I decided to create an acccount on ODesk to see what happens.

My profile was new and empty, so it was hard to find a gig, but after a week or two. I got my first chance. It was a flat $5 job for a couple of hours of work. A client asked me to deminify a chrome extension. 

Sounded shady, but I needed a review, so I spent hafl a day doing it and it went well. I was communicative, did what was asked and more, and the client was happy enough to give me a 5 star review.

THe next job was $5 an hour, which was about a 4x increase from the first one.

This client was also happy and kept comming back to me with more work for a few weeks. I also gradually got my rate up to about $8 and becasue every return was a separate job entry and a separate review, my profile filled up nicely.

I was maybe a few months in at this point an I found the perfect chance. A US developer was looking for someone cheap to do product experiments with. He would pay me $11 an hour for 10-20 hours per week to try out building stuff. He also wanted to increase his mentorhsip skills so he was happy to offer guidance.

This was great, I was now alsmost making an extra salary. 

But, I was also doing 50-60 hours per week. As part of my regular job, i partnered with a colleague to prepare a conference talk, which was also eating into my time. 

Very soon, I felt overworked and because this freelancing gig didn't seem like it would last, I decided I had to stop. 

I told the client and he countered with a full time employment offer. Since he was based in the US, i didn't see this as a possibility, but he did research, and found out you could higher a Croatian company to act as an intermediary. They would hire me, pay my gross sallary with all the taxes and benefits and charge that + an extra feee to the us client for this service.

The client even offered to rase my rate to about 18, so that after taxes and benefits, I'd be getting about 12. I couldn't say no to that.

For 2-3 years, I was perfectly happy with this and nothing changed other than an odd smaller gig to keep my profile on ODesk active.

Because I stagnated, the big leap ahead I got started to get smaller, so I started thinking about what I could do next.

Around this point, a flat-taxed trade business (paušalni obrt) was becoming all the rage, so I told the client I'd like to switch to that, because I'd be getting more money out and I still occasionally get other clients anyway.

This was one of the reasons, sure, but the other was, I got way more flexibility out of it and I could do a repeat of 2012.

I found another client on ODesk, this time for EUR30/hour. ODesk and VAT was taking up 25% of that, but it was still an increase. A month later, I convinced them to work with me directly, off of ODesk. Another month later, they invited me on site because they "wanted me to meet their team", but on my last day there, they offered me a full time engagement.

So the same thing happened again, and I almost doubled my income again.

I also did the same stupid thing again. I didn't just switch, i spent another 2 and a half months, so almost 5 months total, working both jobs, so the previous client could find a replacement that I could help transition.

So we're talking 5 months of 60-70 hours per week. The second most stressful time of my life. 

But that passed and I stuck with this new client as my primary source of income to this day.

I was also more experienced and learned to continually renegotiate my rates, so there was no stagnation this time.

So here we are today.

# Legalities, Getting Paid

* Payoneer initially
* Intermediaries
* Trade business (Obrt), TransferWise, Direct Bank Payments
* LLC, Direct Bank Payments

Note:

Let's talk finances nad legalities.

How did I get paid? It's a pretty short story. For the early ODesk gigs, I used Payoneer. The itnermeddiary company was my employer, so there, it was typical bank account stuff. When I switched to a trade business, for a few months I used TransferWise due to the cheapness, but eventually just switched to direct bank payments, because it was simpler and made me appear more official. For the LLC I opened a few years later,  continued to do the same.

---

# Legalities, Payoneer

* Legality unclear
* Few alternatives at the time

Note:

Using Payoneer was probably sketchy, but the options were limited at the time and I personally didn't know of any.

I'm pretty sure I should've paid some taxes that I didn't, but I don't have an account or any records anymore, so all I can say is, if I ever get a tax bill, I'll be happy to pay it, but it will be a few hundred euros at best.

---

# Legalities, Intermediaries

* Probably fine

Note:
Intermediaries were straightforward — I was essentially employed by a Croatian company, ensuring all legal obligations were covered. This arrangement provided clear benefits like sick leave and vacation, but it also means I was losing more of the gross income.

---

# Legalities, Trade Business (Obrt)

* Never got the questionare results

Note:

For the trade business, I got the infamous questionare as well as a followup set of questions, but after that was answered, I got ghosted. I emailed the agent a bunch of times cause I wanted to close that chapter in my head, but I guess the threat of someone misinterpreting what I was doing will forever loom over my head.

---

# Legalities, LLC

* Should be fine?
* *Breach of legal person*? ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯

Note:
My current LLC should be solid, but you never know. I did hear about the term "breach of legal person", so :shrug

---

# Legalities

* Hourly/daily rates
* No other benefits
* Multiple clients
* Negotiate higher rates

Note:

Generally, I made a really big effort to behave as a sole proprietorship owner, not an employee, 

I get clients to sign clear contracts. I negotiate hourly or daily rates, or a flat per-project fee, not a fixed monthly amount.

I make it clear my sick leave and vacation s my own risk/cost. I have multiple clients. I pay for business and conference trips.

As a result of that bigger risk and cost, I'm able to negotiate higher rates.

---

# Work-Life Balance (WLB)

* More hours, more money?
* Optimize per-hour income
* Optimize free time.

Note:

With the legal stuff out of the way, let's talk work life balance.

For most of my career, I didn't have any. These days, I like to think I'm a bit smarter.

I've managed to teach myself that while more hours more money is true, it's not sustainable  I've also traine myself into having enough confidence to negotiate or look for options.

I'm now also learning that there is an amount that's "enough" and past that, I'd rather do fewer hours than get more money, so I'm building up what I need to start heading in that direction.

---

# WLB Strategies

* Knowing when to stop is a skill
* Set clear "offline" boundaries
* Separate workspace (office, coworking)
* Plan time off in advance

Note:

Over time, I had to build up skills to help with WLB. 

Knowing when to stop is a skill. When you're at an office, it's when it closes, or when most people leave. You are urged to do the same or risk your colleagues disliking you.

At home, your family helps with that, but the pressure is lower nad if you're single, there's no such thing.

So you have to learn to help yourself. Set an alarm when it's hard EOD for you. Kill any business communication past that point. Work from one place in your home only, or if you can, have a separate working location.

Plan your time off months in advance.

There's a bunch you can do, but because you're "On your own", key is to be proactive and intentional with it.

---

# WLB: Practical Advice

* Don't get two kids
* Avoid tiny apartments :)

Note:

Also, don't get two kids nad don't live and work from a 50 sqm appartment containing your entire family.

Or do, and get a crash course in WLB improving skills. :)

---

# Growth Strategies

* Can't get better rates?
* Show your worth to your clients
  * Be proactive
  * Make contributions obvious
  * Fill in roles they are missing in their team

Note:

What if you'e stuck and stagnating. Maybe you can't get better rates.

First, I'll argue that you probably can. If you'e working remotely and keeping a client, you are probably good enough to charge them a bit more, for sure good enough to find someone who pays a bit better.

But if you stronlgy feel that's not the case, then chage it.

First, make sure your client knows your worth. Don't just silently close tickets, be proactive in looking for things in their process and code to improve as you do it. Offer advice. Maybe start mentoring their internal engineerng team. Be active in sync meetings, mediate.

Basically make sure you're visible and as you do that more, you'll get better at it and your negotiatons will go way beter.

Even if the project ends, there will be another, and they will reach out you instead of risking looking for someone else.

---

# Growth: Transferable Skills

* Pragmatism, communication, strategy
* Choose projects that help you grow

Note:

Also think about growing transferable skills. Being really good at React is great, but that only helps with React. 

Understanding good architecture, efficient communication, the difference between stratega and tactics, how to be pragmatic, those work with any language, any framework, on any project.

---

# Growth: Self-Marketing

* Conference talks, meetups
* Side-projects, open source

Note:

And then there's also self marketing. You'r name wont appear on a client's company employee list are they likely to promote you. You can't list "worked at Unicorn" on your resume.

But you can have a great github profile with lot's of contributions on some open source project. You can be listed as a conference speaker and have your talk published on youtube.

And if you do that, your client might want to promote the fact that you're helping them. Other clients will for sure be more likely to take a risk with you, because it won't look like a risk.

If you're early in your career, consider meetups instead, maybe lighting talks, or find someone more senior to partner on a talk with.

---

# Growth: Smaller Ecosystems

* Small communities (Elixir, Vue)
* Easier visibility, less competition

Note:

In my case, what I think helped a great deal was the "choice" of tools I ended up with. 
Elixir and Vue both have relatively small communities. 

Just by having a few years of experience with both and being active, I managed to get speaker slots in several major conferences. I'm able to make small contributions to major open source elixir and vue projecsts. I can write a bloc article and there's a good chance a newsletter will publish it. 

Being in a small pond means you don't need to be as big to get a name for yourself.

So maybe consider a smaller language or framwork. Don't go for an extreme niche, but it doesn't have to be React.

---

# Growth: Leveraging Modern Tooling

* Use AI to offer more, find more work, learn
* Expand potential clients

Note:
Modern tooling, especially AI, also significantly extends your capabilities. 

I'm not talking vibe coding, but I am talking that, while you may not be a guy that writes scripts (like I'm not), you ca use AI to write a script for you, proof read it, test it and get something automated in under an hour that would previously take a day for you to figure out.

That's what i did a ways days ago.

You can spend 2 hours debuging 150 lines of complex code to try and figure out why it's failing in a rare scenario, or you can try asking a AI.

You can try out a new technology by doing a bit of vibe coding, then read what it spits out, learn a thing or two about it, improve it and suddenly you know a bit more of a new language or a new framework, expanding your option.

You can ask it to generate an architectural diagram of some codebase to get a quick overview of how things are connected. I do that almost daily for parts of a big codebase.

You can ask it for advice on how to reword a slide or your speaker notes. Ask it to proof read or to look for inconsistencies.

I don't think AI will replace, i think what it's already doing is it's allowing us to do more in less time, which is great if you want to optimize for free time, like i'm trying to do.

It also expands your options, because you are able to offer service you wouldn't otherwise.

# Remote Work Evolution

* Then $5 an hour was pretty good, 11 amazing; 30 unimaginable
* COVID made working from home more common
* Easier to start a company

Note:

Now all this is my experience, starting 13 years ago. I would call it a success. I think a good amount of luck helped, but my ability to communicate and general pragmatism was also useful throughout.

Someone else who started back then will probably have a completely different story.

Someone starting today? Definitely completely different.

But in my opinion the biggest difference was that when I started, Croatia was seen as a source of cheap labor. When my hourly rate was 18, I know for a fact companies in the US were charging $200-400 per hour of consulting, depending on their location.

Back then, also, almost no one working remotely and now, COVID made sure this is a perfectly standard opton for regualar company employees.

So these days, doubling your income within half a year by switching to remote is unlikely, and the ability to work from home is not such a big deal.

So I guess I'm having a bit of a harder time figuring out what would make it attractive.

I would say, probably, it still allows you more flexibility than regular employment, and it gives you more options in what to work with or on. And, you still probably get significantly more money, just not as big of a difference as it was back then.

---

# Story

* Talk to people!

Note:

We're almost there, so time for a story.

On my first international elixir conference, bout 5 years ago, I got to meet Saša Jurić. Some of you probably know him or off him, but for those that don't, he's a prominent Elixir engineer and an author of several books on Elixir.

We met at the conference venue. I greeted him and started speaking to him. In English. He seemed confused and told me "you do know we can speak croatian, right?" A switch flipped and we continued in croatian.

I've been remote for 13 years. I live with a wife and two kids, oldest getting close to 3 years, so she hasn't been speaking for THAT long. I'm also not a very social guy and rarely hang out with a lot of other people. Mostly, it's just the family.

So for the first 10 years of remote, half of my spoken conversations and almost 100% of my technical conversations was in English. The other half was with my wife.

So I guess I started defaulting to english.

That's what happens.

---
# Conclusion

* Was it worth it?

Note:

There really isn't a straighforward conclusion here. Yes, you can get more money. No, I don't think it's extremely stresful finding work, at least not any more than finding a regular job, at least not in our industry.

There are regular jobs that are equally or more stresful than being self-employed. 

The sources of stress tend to be different.

Weird things happen when you mostly speak english.
