# 13 Years Remote
## Thriving as a Web Developer Without Burning Out
### Nikola Begedin

# Intro

* I work primarily with Vue and Elixir
* Had two non-remote jobs total
* Partially remote since \~2011
* Fully remote since end of 2012

Note:
Hey everyone! I'm Nikola, and I primarily work with Vue and Elixir. Honestly, this talk barely kept my Weblica streak alive—I got invited last minute. Luckily, thanks to a broadly relevant topic and some handy AI tools, I managed to put this together in time. Today, I'll talk about my experiences working remotely long-term without burning out. Just to give you an idea of how long that's been, I've been fully remote since late 2012, after only two brief, non-remote junior roles. It’s been quite a journey!

# My Remote Journey

* 2011, UpWork (then oDesk), \$5/hour
* Quickly rose to \$11/hour, part-time
* Full-time remote offer shortly after
* Stagnation for 2-3 years
* New gig at €30/hour, became full-time
* Avoided future stagnation

Note:
My first job was actually in Čakovec, at a junior .NET position. Some JS development quickly got in, but for the most part, I was following my plan of being a .NET developer.

I got the itch after about a year, and found a salary upgrade in Varaždin, cause that's what juniors do.

A year after that, because I was living alone, and did basically nothing, I decided I might try some side gigs online. Freelancing was starting to get talked about, but it was still very early.

I signed up for an ODesk account, and started looking for gigs.

It's tough to get something when your profile is empty, so just sent offers until someone accepted.

I got a flat $5 job to deminify a chrome extension. Basically, I was asked to format the code and rename the variables based on what it seems they're doing, to make it at least semi understandable. It took a few hours, so it was not worth the money, but it did get me my first 5 star review.

This got me a $5 per hour gig, and that client, other then giving more reviews, also came back to me a few times with more work.

After that, my profile started to look good, so I landed an 11 dollar an hour gig for 10-20 hours a week.

Now, I was making some very nice money. Basically a second sallary for less than half the time it took me to get the first one.

But I coldn't maintain this pace so eventually, I decided I'd stop. I told the client that and he countered with a full time position.

He was already looking into it and said he found a Croatian company that acts as an intermediarey to higher for foreign businesses. It was basically the same kind of outsorcing a lot of local companies did at the time, but for a small flat fee and with zero managegement. He was willing to upp my hourly rate to $18 so that my net rate would get to about $12.

I accepted and that was my next 2-3 years. Basically, I stagnated, but at double the sallary I had, this was fine for a while.

My Croatian colleagues started catching up eventually, and this got me to wake up and look for ways to increase my income further.

I learned about trade businesses and decided to switch to that. For the same hourly rate, I got a bit more net money, but that wasn't the main reason. It meant I could more easily extend and find new clients.

I quickly found a new gig on ODesk, this time for 30 euros an hour. I did the same thing again. Kept working the old job, full time, with extra hours here. Except now it was 20-30. 

In a month, they offered to switch from Odesk to working directly B2B. This eliminated the ODesk fee.

Another month later, they invited me on site to meet their engineers. On my last day there, they offered me a full time engagement.

And again, I decided not to burn bridges and continue working full time for the old gig for another 3 months so they could find a replacement that I could transition the work to.

So for 4-5 months, I worked 60-70 hour weeks. I would not recommended.

But that eventually stoped and the €30 client is still my current primary client. Here, I was smarter and continued renegotiating for higher rates, so there was no stagnation this time.

Now keep in mind, I'm talking just about the major players. I still om occassion take smaller bits of work either from previous clients, or from new ones.

# Legalities, Getting Paid

* Payoneer initially
* Intermediaries
* Trade business (Obrt), TransferWise, Direct Bank Payments
* LLC, Direct Bank Payments

Note:

How did I get payed. For the early ODesk gigs, I used payoneer. When I switched to the trade business, for a few months I used TransferWise due to the cheapness, but eventually just switched to direct bank payments. 

---

# Legalities, Payoneer

* Legality unclear
* Few alternatives at the time

Note:
Using Payoneer was probably sketchy, but the options were limited, I didn't know better and even if I wanted to do something about it now, I don't have an account or any records. If I ever get a tax bill, I'll be happy to pay it, but it will be a few hundred euros at best.

---

# Legalities, Intermediaries

* Probably fine

Note:
Intermediaries were straightforward — I was essentially employed by a Croatian company, ensuring all legal obligations were covered. This arrangement provided clear benefits like sick leave and vacation, but it also means I was losing more of the gros income.

---

# Legalities, Trade Business (Obrt)

* Never got the questionare results

Note:
I received a questionnaire but never heard back. Maintaining proper B2B relationships and multiple clients gave me confidence I was compliant, but you never know with our tax environment.

---

# Legalities, LLC

* Should be fine?
* *Breach of legal person*? ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯

Note:
An LLC should be solid, though investigations into trade businesses stirred some worries about potential legal issues. Generally, it's probably okay.

---

# Legalities

* Hourly/daily rates
* No paid vacations or sick leave
* Negotiate higher rates
* Multiple clients
* Behave professionally

Note:

Generally though, I strived to be legal. I'm B2B so I always act B2B
I negotiate hourly or daily rates, or a flat per-project fee. 
I pay for my own vacation and sick leave. I have multiple clients. I pay for my business trips, etc.

If you want employee perks, go the employment route. If you're B2B, charge rates accounting for additional risks. Act accordingly.

---

# Work-Life Balance (WLB)

* More hours, more money?
* Negotiate higher rates, not more hours
* Optimize per-hour income
* Decide when it's enough, optimize free time.

Note:

So how did I deal with work life balance. Early on, obviously, not at all. These days, I think I'm a bit smarter.

I've managed to teach myself that while more hours more money is true, it's also the least optimal route.

I've also learned that I was underselling myself early on and that I should be afraid to ask for more or leave for more.

I'm also learning that there's an amount that's enough and that at that point, I can optimize for free time - negotiate higher rates, then work less hours.

---

# WLB Strategies

* Knowing when to stop is a kill
* Set clear "offline" boundaries
* Separate workspace (office, coworking)
* Plan time off in advance

Note:

Over time, I've develope strategies on improving WLB. After certain hours, I kill my business communication. Unless there's a fire, 17:30 is a hard stop for me. I don't carry my laptop everywhere. I work from one location.

I plan time off months im advance, otherwise i never take it.

---

# WLB: Practical Advice

* Don't get two kids
* Avoid tiny apartments
* Use coworking spaces or libraries

Note:
Seriously—kids and small apartments complicate remote work. Find external spaces for better productivity.

---

# Growth Strategies

* Can't get better rates?
* Develop skills actively
* Make contributions obvious
* Pursue growth (senior, staff, EM?)

Note:
Note: But what if you cant get better rates. Well, then you have to change that fact. Find ways to grow. 

Develop a strategy for career and skill growht. Do you want to become an EM, or increase on the technical path?

Also, become someone your clients will want to want to work with and come back to. If they keep coming back, you have more time to grow skills as you spend less time looking for clients. 

Good communication skills really help with this part and just having and using those can be a big value add to your clients.

---

# Growth: Transferable Skills

* Pragmatism, communication, strategy
* Choose projects to boost growth

Note:
Transferable skills trump specific technical skills at senior levels. Communication and pragmatism are particularly valuable, to you and to your client, especially if they are a startup.

---

# Growth: Self-Marketing

* Conference talks, meetups
* Side-projects, open source

Note:

So all the stuff I said helps negotiating better rates, but to get better clients, there is also the aspect of marketability. 

You need to promote yourself. Grow your network of recommendations, find ways to show off the work you're doing for your clients. Have side-projects if you can. Contribute to open source. 

Do conference talks, go to and speak at meetups. It's not THAT hard to get in. If it's your first one and you're scared, find someone more experienced to partner with. 

---

# Growth: Smaller Ecosystems

* Small communities (Elixir, Vue)
* Easier visibility, less competition

Note:
What really helped me here was the "choice" of tools I ended up with. Elixir and Vue are both relatively small communities. Just by having a few years of experience with both and being active, I managed to get speaker slots in several major conferences. Being in a small pond means you don't need to be as big to get a name for yourself.

So maybe consider choosing a smaller framework. Don't go for an extreme niche, but it doesn't have to be React.

# Remote Work Evolution

* Then $5 an hour was senior, 11 a dream; 30 unimaginable
* Dynamics evolved significantly
* Easier to start a trade business or LLC

Note:
The landscape today is vastly more favorable to remote freelancers compared to when I started.

---

# Leveraging Modern Tooling

* Use AI tools to extend capabilities
* Produce and review code in unfamiliar languages
* Write automation, scripts, CI, infrastructure
* Learn as you use

Note:
Modern tooling, especially AI, significantly extends your capabilities. For example, AI helps me generate scripts or code snippets in languages I understand but don't fluently write. It's like understanding a spoken language clearly but struggling to speak it fluently—comprehension outpaces active ability. Using AI for such tasks saves considerable time, allowing me to focus more effectively on areas where I'm strongest.

I drafted an outline of this talk using Chat GPT. I basically rewrote it all a few times after that, but getting a "complete" starting point can really speed you up.

The other day, I client asked me to do something on a codebase I haven't touched in a while. I used cursor's agent to refamiliarize myself with the code, quickly used it to generate some missing test coverage and then that gave me the confidence to refactor and extned a feature. With a bit of extra time, I also managed to write a script that really helped stabilise the e2e tests in CI. I'm not skilled at writing scripts.

---

# Story Time

* Talk to people!

Note:
Years of remote technical communication changed my daily language habits. An amusing incident at ElixirConf reminded me how remote work shapes even basic interactions.

---
# Conclusion

* A journey worth taking
* 100% would recommend

Note:

There really isn't a straighforward conclusion here. Yes, you can get more money. No, I don't think it's extremely stresful finding work, at least not any more than finding a regular job. 

THere are regular jobs that are equally or more stresful than being self-employed. 

The sources of stress tend to be different.

Weird things happen when you mostly speak english.
